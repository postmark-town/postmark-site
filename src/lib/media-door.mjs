// media-door.mjs — ONE OWNER for "is this URL the town's own media door?"
//
// The rule used to live unexported inside tools/lib/town.mjs, where the
// resident-profile reader applies it at BUILD time (postmark#2950: a settled
// avatar_url is admitted onto a resident's page only when it is the town's own
// door, so a PROFILE.md cannot point the site's <img> at a third-party host).
// The world cockpit reads the same field at RUNTIME, in the browser, and had no
// origin check at all — the same question answered in two places, one of them
// not answering it.
//
// So the predicate moved here and both readers call it. This module is
// deliberately PURE — no node builtins, no fs, no yaml, nothing that cannot be
// bundled into a client <script> — because src/lib/world-cockpit.mjs ships to
// the browser. `URL` is the only thing it stands on, and that is a global in
// both runtimes. If this file ever needs a node import, the two readers have
// stopped sharing a question and it should split again rather than grow one.
//
// WHY A WHOLE MODULE FOR FOUR LINES: the alternative is the rule written twice,
// and the failure mode of the second copy is silent — the day the door moves to
// another host the build-time reader refuses and the browser reader keeps
// drawing, or the reverse, and nothing reds.
